      <h1>Gabriel's CS1 Work Site</h1>
      <p>This site represents work that I have done in support of my efforts to learn to program in the CS1 course at SUNY Oswego during the Spring 2018 semester. The materials will be temporally organized for the most part. Links to external sites that pertain to computer programming, problem solving, Java, Web development, and relatedc matters will be placed after the personally created artifacts.
